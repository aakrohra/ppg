        "description": "My personal project was making a board game to teach others about Chinese cuisine. The goal was to include approximately 50 dishes and 50 corresponding ingredients to show others the diversity of Chinese cuisine. I also decided on the global context \"Personal and Cultural Expression\" because my project helped me explore aspects of my culture and find out more about my roots. \n\nMy board game showcases my months of research on the different regions of cuisine in China and the various dishes and ingredients that can be found in each region. The main content of the game can be found on the dish and ingredient cards. As well, there are other parts of my game such as the game board, dice, instructions, tokens, player pieces, and cards. All of these elements ensure the player has fun while learning about Chinese cuisine! ",
