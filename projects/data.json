The reason for choosing this as my personal project stems from a multitude of reasons. I have always been interested in cooking and decided that this project opportunity was the perfect time to learn a new skill. Learning how to cook has a multitude of benefits as well, one being the ability to expand one's knowledge of personal and cultural expression. This is incredibly important as it is important to acknowledge one's cultural background.  ",

The goal was to include approximately 50 dishes and 50 corresponding ingredients to show others the diversity of Chinese cuisine. I also decided on the global context \"Personal and Cultural Expression\" because my project helped me explore aspects of my culture and find out more about my roots. \n\nMy board game showcases my months of research on the different regions of cuisine in China and the various dishes and ingredients that can be found in each region. The main content of the game can be found on the dish and ingredient cards. As well, there are other parts of my game such as the game board, dice, instructions, tokens, player pieces, and cards. All of these elements ensure the player has fun while learning about Chinese cuisine! ",

        "description": "For my personal project, I decided to learn the art of Graphic Design. I took online courses, read books, consulted websites to familiarize myself with the basics of graphic design. Then I repeated it for the elements of design. \n\nMy goal was to simplify complex topics and make them more accessible to my generation. That's why I converted books' lessons to intuitive graphics!\n\nTo constantly hone my skills, I posted at least 10 graphics a week on an Instagram account @learning.simplified. I covered financial topics like Bitcoin, as well as many books! I talked about \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" by Dale Carnegie, \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" by Robert Kiyosaki and \"Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World\" by Admiral McRaven.",

        "description": "I've always been interested in the arts and it was sad that my enthusiasm only continued to diminish over time. So, I decided to explore a new medium (I guess crochet is more of a craft), while also further developing my knowledge of relationships between local and global processes. What better way to do that if not selling the bucket hats I've learned to crochet for lots of money? Disregarding the fact that I never got around to the actual selling part, learning how to crochet and then becoming a slave to the hook and yarn was enjoyable enough. I'm glad that I was able to pursue this lost interest of mine while learning about small businesses.  ",
