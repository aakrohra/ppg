I have always been interested in cooking and decided that this project opportunity was the perfect time to learn a new skill. Learning how to cook has a multitude of benefits as well, one being the ability to expand one's knowledge of personal and cultural expression. This is incredibly important as it is important to acknowledge one's cultural background.  ",

However, my book is about the critical global issue of deforestation. I hope that my book can inspire others around the world.

My kitchen design has a modern-contemporary look to it as well as a hint of the Scandinavian style. Modern designs emphasize sleekness and simplicity-there is not a lot of clutter or accessories involved with a modern style. Other modern elements in this kitchen design are clean, crisp lines of the white marble countertop, cabinets/shelves and subway style backsplash. This space takes it a step further by reflecting light with white ceramic tiles on the walls and floor. I also pushed the cabinetry higher up towards the ceiling to create more clearance height on the counter tops and create a sense of height. My younger sister's bedroom design most resembles the  transitional style. It is a modern mix of classic and contemporary styles. Transitional elements in my design include: Upholster a tufted, curved headboard (a traditional element) with a steel-gray fabric (a more modern element), use of two colour palette, more neutral ; colours, includes tone-on-tone color palettes, and shades of blue or pink for bedrooms decorated in this style. I also designed a Nordic and modern style living room for fun.\n",

The application records each move made, with the milliseconds you held each switch. Like this you can make a sequence of moves, called \"sketches\", that can be repeated with the REPLAY function. Another cool feature is that sketches can be saved as a file and pulled up later. ",

        "description": "My personal project, titled “Matargashti: A Beginner’s Expression of ‘Play’ through Crochet”, is aimed at learning the basics of crochet and creating a crochet cardigan that expresses myself. My inquiry question is “How can a beginner use an artistic medium as a means of expression?” I titled my project the Hindi word, ‘Matargashti’ (मटरमटर), as I think my cardigan conveys the idea of playfulness present in the word’s meaning well. ‘Matar’ (मटर) is a word of Arabic origin and means rain. ‘Gashti’ (मटर) is a word of Persian origin and means to roam. So, the two words strung together refer to ‘roaming in the rain’. The term arises from the stories of village people who would dance in the first rains and enjoy the smell of the wet earth. I used soft pastel shades, with a simple fluffy flower element. The final product is simple, bright, and playful!",

Additionally, they help us study the laws of nature and solve global issues.

Though, unfortunately, my culinary abilities only amount to that of a ten-year-old’s. (I can make udon and cup noodles, but that was about it...).

My goal here was to be able to develop the skill to go from the vague mental image to being able to hand-write each of the 2,136 common use Kanji in Japanese. This manifested in the form of hand-writing a brief piece of Japanese, with a personal English translation attached.",

        "description": "For my personal project, I decided to learn the art of Graphic Design. I took online courses, read books, consulted websites to familiarize myself with the basics of graphic design. Then I repeated it for the elements of design. \n\nMy goal was to simplify complex topics and make them more accessible to my generation. That's why I converted books' lessons to intuitive graphics!\n\nTo constantly hone my skills, I posted at least 10 graphics a week on an Instagram account @learning.simplified. I covered financial topics like Bitcoin, as well as many books! I talked about \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" by Dale Carnegie, \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" by Robert Kiyosaki and \"Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World\" by Admiral McRaven.",

So, I decided to explore a new medium (I guess crochet is more of a craft), while also further developing my knowledge of relationships between local and global processes. What better way to do that if not selling the bucket hats I've learned to crochet for lots of money? Disregarding the fact that I never got around to the actual selling part, learning how to crochet and then becoming a slave to the hook and yarn was enjoyable enough. I'm glad that I was able to pursue this lost interest of mine while learning about small businesses.  ",
