The application records each move made, with the milliseconds you held each switch. Like this you can make a sequence of moves, called \"sketches\", that can be repeated with the REPLAY function. Another cool feature is that sketches can be saved as a file and pulled up later. ",

My inquiry question is “How can a beginner use an artistic medium as a means of expression?” I titled my project the Hindi word, ‘Matargashti’ (मटरमटर), as I think my cardigan conveys the idea of playfulness present in the word’s meaning well. ‘Matar’ (मटर) is a word of Arabic origin and means rain. ‘Gashti’ (मटर) is a word of Persian origin and means to roam. So, the two words strung together refer to ‘roaming in the rain’. The term arises from the stories of village people who would dance in the first rains and enjoy the smell of the wet earth. I used soft pastel shades, with a simple fluffy flower element. The final product is simple, bright, and playful!",

Through this project, my aim was to develop my identity and relationships, as well as my personal and cultural expression. I put my amateur cooking skills to test by making a variety of dishes ranging from breakfast items to desserts. The process involved many hours spent on research (both from online sources and family members), lots of preparation to make the cooking experience smooth, and constant scribbling of recipes in my notes. Overall, it was a very enjoyable and fulfilling experience, despite the challenges. ",

The global context that I chose to aim was scientific and technical innovation. Scientific innovations are the things that shape the future. They help us make our life easier and efficient. Additionally, they help us study the laws of nature and solve global issues. Artificial intelligence, virtual assistants, and self driving cars, all of which require programing knowledge, are a part of scientific innovation and will shape the future. I believe learning Python will improve my understanding of AI and lay a good foundation for my career.",

Growing up in a family where there wasn’t a lot of importance held in family bonding time, the only times we would have any kind of emotional connection was while eating. Though, unfortunately, my culinary abilities only amount to that of a ten-year-old’s. (I can make udon and cup noodles, but that was about it...). So, In order to grow closer to not only my family but my own culture, I decided to learn how to make a few Chinese dishes (appetizer, main dish, dessert) and then write my own recipe for it, as well as research the origin and history behind them.",

A free site used to make animations. I put it to use for my video as well. The global context I chose was Scientific and Technological Innovation.

That's why I converted books' lessons to intuitive graphics!\n\nTo constantly hone my skills, I posted at least 10 graphics a week on an Instagram account @learning.simplified. I covered financial topics like Bitcoin, as well as many books! I talked about \"How to Win Friends and Influence People\" by Dale Carnegie, \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" by Robert Kiyosaki and \"Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World\" by Admiral McRaven.",

What better way to do that if not selling the bucket hats I've learned to crochet for lots of money? Disregarding the fact that I never got around to the actual selling part, learning how to crochet and then becoming a slave to the hook and yarn was enjoyable enough. I'm glad that I was able to pursue this lost interest of mine while learning about small businesses.  ",
